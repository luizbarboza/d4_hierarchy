Before you can compute a [hierarchical layout](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_hierarchy/latest/d4_hierarchy/d4_hierarchy-library.html), you need a root node. If your data is already in a hierarchical format, such as JSON, you can pass it directly to [hierarchy](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_hierarchy/latest/d4_hierarchy/hierarchy.html); otherwise, you can rearrange tabular data, such as comma-separated values (CSV), into a hierarchy using [stratify](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_hierarchy/latest/d4_hierarchy/Stratify-class.html).
